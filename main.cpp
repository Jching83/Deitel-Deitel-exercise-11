 * 2.17 (Printing) Write a program that prints the numbers 1 to 4 *
 * on the same line with each pair of adjacent numbers separated  *
 * by one space. Do this several ways:                            *
 * A. Using one statement with one stream insertion operator.     *
 * B. Using one statement with four stream insertion              *
 * operators.                                                     *
 * C. Using four statements.                                      *
